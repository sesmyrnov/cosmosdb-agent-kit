## Improvements

### [Unreleased]

_Improvements pending next release_

#### 2026-01-27: Testing Framework - Skills Must Be Loaded First

- **Scenario**: ecommerce-order-api
- **Iteration**: 001-dotnet
- **Issue**: Iteration 001 was run WITHOUT loading the skill kit first, making it a baseline test rather than a skill kit test
- **Improvement**: Updated testing framework documentation to emphasize skills MUST be loaded before each iteration
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `testing/README.md` - Added "CRITICAL: Install Skills FIRST" section
  - `testing/scenarios/_iteration-template.md` - Added "Skills Verification" section
  - `iteration-001-dotnet/ITERATION.md` - Marked as baseline (no skills)

#### 2026-01-27: Enum Serialization Mismatch Bug (ecommerce-order-api)

- **Scenario**: ecommerce-order-api
- **Iteration**: 001-dotnet
- **Issue**: Agent generated code where Cosmos SDK stored enums as integers but queries searched for strings, causing status queries to return empty results
- **Improvement**: ✅ Added new rule `sdk-serialization-enums.md` with guidance on consistent enum serialization
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `rules/sdk-serialization-enums.md` (new)
  - `AGENTS.md` (added section 4.10)

#### 2026-01-27: Missing Pagination Pattern (ecommerce-order-api)

- **Scenario**: ecommerce-order-api
- **Iteration**: 001-dotnet
- **Issue**: List queries returned all results without pagination, which would fail at scale
- **Analysis**: Rule `query-pagination.md` already exists with good content - the agent simply didn't apply it
- **Action**: No rule change needed, but highlights that agents may not always apply existing rules
- **Priority**: HIGH (for observation)
- **Files Modified**: None - rule already exists

#### 2026-01-27: Missing RU Diagnostics Logging (ecommerce-order-api)

- **Scenario**: ecommerce-order-api
- **Iteration**: 001-dotnet
- **Issue**: No logging of CosmosDiagnostics or RU consumption for debugging/monitoring
- **Analysis**: Rule `monitoring-ru-consumption.md` already exists with comprehensive SDK examples - agent didn't apply it
- **Action**: No rule change needed - rule has .NET examples with logging, telemetry, and middleware patterns
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (for observation)
- **Files Modified**: None - rule already exists
